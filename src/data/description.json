Trust our process, you are in good hands.</strong></p><p>All questions have been <strong>written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time! </strong>You can see for yourself some of the amazing <strong>testimonials</strong> from our students who have aced the real exam:</p><p>=======</p><p><strong>FEATURED REVIEWS:</strong></p><p><strong>5&nbsp;stars:</strong> <em>I just passed my SAA-C03 today and I would like to thank Stephan for creating such great content. I went through his course and did these practice papers as well. And the questions were really similar to the ones which came in the actual exams. I am still stunned with my score since </em><strong><em>I got 1000/1000</em></strong><em>. If this does not clear your doubt then nothing will. Don't think twice, take this course. - Nisha V.</em></p><p><strong>5&nbsp;stars:</strong><em> Great exams, similar to those found at the real exam (which I passed with a </em><strong><em>score of 845</em></strong><em>). Great job Stephane! - Ignacio R.</em></p><p><strong>5&nbsp;stars:</strong><em> Excellent test prep. </em><strong><em>I passed with a score of 1000</em></strong><em>!!. If you just do Stephane's Solution Architect course and this test course, you will pass the certification for sure.

These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight. The engineering team at the startup has observed that there is a significant performance lag during the initial hour from 6 pm to 7 pm. The application is able to function normally thereafter.</p><p>As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend addressing the performance bottleneck during that initial hour of traffic spike?</p><ol><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a lifecycle hook that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a step scaling policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.<br><br></p></li></ol><p><strong>What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Correct: 1.</em></p><p><em>The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. The engineering team can create a daily scheduled action to kick-off before 6pm and hence this is the correct option.</em></p><p><em>Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates. Lifecycle hooks are not the correct choice for this use-case.</em></p><p><em>With target tracking scaling policies, you choose a scaling metric and set a target value. Application Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value.</em></p><p><em>With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods.</em></p><p><em>Both the target tracking as well as step scaling policies entail a lag wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. Therefore we would still see performance lag during some part of the initial hour.</em></p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong></p><p>My name is Stéphane Maarek,&nbsp;I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.
